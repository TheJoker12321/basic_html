                Golan, who is considered a pioneer in Mizrahi music, 
                gained fame in 1997 after releasing his third album, 
                "Without You," produced by Tamir Kaliski and Ze'ev 
                Nechama from Ethnix. With sales of nearly 400,000 copies, 
                the album became the best-selling album in Israel ever. 
                That same year, Golan became the first singer from this 
                genre to win the title of Singer of the Year in the annual 
                Hebrew Songs Chart of Reshet Gimmel, and his song "Tears" 
                became the first Mizrahi song to win the title of Song of 
                the Year.

                Golan's songs and albums enjoyed commercial success in both 
                the first and second decades of the 21st century. He sold 
                over three million albums in Israel, and in 2012 he was the 
                most financially successful singer in the country. 
                He won the title of "Singer of the Year" fifteen times, 
                "Song of the Year" twelve times, "Singer of the Decade" 
                twice, and the title of "The Singer of the State" in honor 
                of Israel's 70th anniversary celebrations.

                Golan was a football player in Liga Alef for Hapoel Marmorek
                from Rehovot. In June 2014, he and his business partners 
                purchased ownership of the club.

                Cohen was born and raised in Kiryat Bialik to the Hebrew 
                singer Ilan Cohen and grew up in a musically traditional 
                family. 
                At the age of five, he began studying at the Kiryat Bialik 
                Conservatory. As part of his music studies, he learned to 
                play a variety of instruments: piano, viola, guitar, clarinet, 
                and violin. At the age of 11, he began performing as a keyboardist 
                in live performances. In 2018, he released his debut album 
                "Remembered in Her Eyes." In September of that year, 
                he released the single "In the Moments You're Leaving," 
                which received extensive airplay on radio stations, reached 
                second place on Media Forest's weekly chart, and achieved great 
                success in the annual song charts. In October, he wrote and 
                composed the song "Happy Without Me" for Omer Adam. 
                The song was co-written with Loren Cohen and produced and 
                arranged by Tamir Tzur. In December, the song "Inside My Head," 
                which Cohen wrote and composed for Kobi Peretz, was released. 
                That same year, the song "I'll Manage Alone" by Eyal Golan, 
                which Cohen co-wrote and composed with Tamir Tzur, was also released. 
                In March 2019, he released the song "24 Hours" together with singer 
                Dudu Aharon and DJ Vivo. 
                That year, he also released the song "What Does He Know" with the band 
                Ultras, and the song "What Are You Doing to Me" with Omri Segal. 
                In August of that year, he released the song "I Hate You," 
                and in November, "Cipralex."
